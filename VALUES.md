# Headway Values

## Simplicity

Headway should be easy to use. This should inform all decisions made for the project. Headway should be simple to use for end users, simple to set up for system administrators and simple to extend and modify by developers.

## Privacy

Headway should not persist data about its users on the backend under any circumstances. A user's recourse for deciding that they don't trust [maps.earth](https://maps.earth/) should always be available, celebrated and encouraged: hosting their own instance.

## Responsibility

Headway should not under any circumstances endanger people, animals or the planet. Nothing should be added that could encourage or enable distracted driving, and people should be able to get transportation options other than driving.
