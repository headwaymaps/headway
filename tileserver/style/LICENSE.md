Attribution for the design defined in this repository needs not to be provided

Products or services using maps derived from OpenMapTiles schema need to visibly
credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to
http://openmaptiles.org/.

For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the
credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[© OpenMapTiles](http://openmaptiles.org/)
[© OpenStreetMap contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual
description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.
