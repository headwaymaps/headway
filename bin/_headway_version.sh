# Headway has basically two kinds of artifacts:
#
# 1. Map data, like tiles for rendering and routing and the geocoding database.
# 2. Containers that run services which use that map data.
#
# Theses things will change as the software evolves, and how these changes get
# deployed depends on the particular changes.
#
# This file attempts to track when breaking changes occur. Something like
# semantic versioning usually makes sense for this kind of thing in software
# libraries, but semver is less well suited for versioning an entire
# application deployment like headway. So, I don't claim that this is
# *strictly* "semantic" versioning.

# Tracks backwards incompatibilities between the built assets (map tiles, OTP
# graph, etc.)
#
# Major bumps to HEADWAY_DATA_TAG mean new versions of assets must be built and
# deployed before the corresponding containers can be deployed.
#
# A bump in the DATA tag pretty much always implies a bump in the CONTAINER
# tag, but not necessarily vice-versa.
